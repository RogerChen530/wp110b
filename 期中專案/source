The design of this project is referenced from DelftStack, website is as follows: https://reurl.cc/1ZzZYD.
Only HTML and JS parts are for reference, CSS is for self-design.
This project is a simple counter that can effectively help users count the progress of certain repetitive tasks.
I used HTML to indicate that this is a counter program.
And also used JavaScript as the main language of the program
Last but not least, I used CSS to make my program looked more beautiful.
So this is how I made this program, thanks for teacher's teaching in the whole semester.
